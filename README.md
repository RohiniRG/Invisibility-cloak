# Invisibility-cloak
Creating the magic of invisibility using OpenCV

## Inspiration
Harry Potter's infamous adventures with the invisibility cloak.

## What it does
* Performing the ANDing between masked and the captured background frame to create the effect of invisibility. 
* We have used the color RED cloth as our invisibility cloak.

## How we built it
* Built with love and pure admiration for Harry Potter by using OpenCV and its image processing techniques.
* We used noise reduction techniques like opening and dilation methods.

## Challenges we ran into
* Noise reduction techniques.
* Finding the right HSV values for masking.
* Figuring out the logic for masking.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Managed to built this within 30 minutes.
* Get to implement what we learned.

## What we learned
We learned how to use OpenCV techniques to create the effect of invisibility by using bitwise operation and masking techniques.
